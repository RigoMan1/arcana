    description: 'Your current state and perspective.'

    description: 'Challenges you are facing or will face.'
  - name: 'work'
    description: 'Potential future outcomes and opportunities.'
  - name: 'personality'
    description: Key traits and qualities. This position uncovers your core characteristics and how they influence your actions and decisions.

    - gather implied information from the user's responses eg. astrological sign from birthdate
    - ask for for specifics if the user's response is incomplete eg. user provides only a birthdate without a year
    - derive necessary information from the user's responses to fill in the bio eg. birth year if only birthdate is provided
    
    ask the following questions:
    - Name
    - Birthdate: gather complete birthdate
  after this instruct the user to draw their first card and drop the card in a position of their choice.
    

    if any details are missing, ask for clarification:
    For instance, if you mention your birthdate as "Dec 20," I will ask, "Could you please specify the year?" Similarly, if you say, "Yes, I have a girlfriend," I will follow up with, "What's her name, and how long have you been together?"

    after completing the questions, instruct the user to continue to the app.
    !do not read the information back to the user
